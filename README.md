# expl
An expression language for explorable, explainable programming.

This is a very early work in progress.

Goals:
- A familiar syntax to most programmers, analysts and modellers, without feeling like "programming" (like spreadsheet formulae)
- Fast numerical calculation (better than Pandas)
- No such thing as slow code; the compiler find a near-optimal execution (no penalty for the natural expression of a result)
- Easily embeddable in applications and other programming languages
- Support for explorable interfaces and extreme debug-ability
- Portability to parallel GPU execution and future hardware
