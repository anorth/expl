# expl
An expression language for explorable, explainable programming.

This is a very early work in progress.

This language is very much inspired by Bret Victor's ideas about
[tools and media for understanding](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#tools),
and specifically their potential to help humanity address climate breakdown
(among other species-wide challenges). It's a language for modelling and analysis, and for
embedding in media for understanding. Expl aims to give humans the tools they need to
understand and reverse global warming üåè.

Goals:
- A familiar, accessible syntax to most programmers, analysts and modellers, without feeling 
too much like "programming" (c.f. spreadsheet formulae)
- Fast numerical calculation (better than Pandas)
- Powerful symbolic calculation (think Mathematica)
- No such thing as slow code; the compiler find a near-optimal execution
 (no penalty for the natural expression of a result)
- Easily embeddable in applications and other programming languages
- Support for explorable interfaces and extreme debug-ability
- Portability to parallel GPU execution and future hardware

*Expl* is not a very good name. I'm looking for a new one.
